# Overwhelmed?

There is so much to learn!  In the 90's when I was first getting online, learning about newsgroups, html, and the various facets that made up our internet at the time, there was not nearly as much as there is now.

Now, there are abstractions upon abstractions, simplyfying complicated structures into entities that make beautiful platforms, products, and of course Something as a Service.  Our online world has been monetized through and through, and if I don't catch up I'll be left behind holding nothing but internet pennies...

It's not so much that it is overwhelming but that I want to learn it all and I don't have enough hours in my day!
